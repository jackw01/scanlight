# parts list

## 3d printing note
Printing orientation for all parts should be obvious based on the design. Print all parts in black ABS. The "Support on Build Plate Only" or equivalent option should be used since several parts have counterbore holes.

## scanlight v2/v3

### scanlight v2/v3 only
* assembled PCB
* front diffuser (4x3x0.118" ACRYLITE® Satinice WD008 DF light-diffusing acrylic, or standard white acrylic with <50% light transmittance)
* 3D printed PCB baseplate
* 3D printed reflector box housing (interior surfaces to be painted with paint containing only extra fine leafing aluminum flake pigment, such as Dupli-Color CS101)
* 3D printed diffuser bezel
* 4x 6mm diameter x 3mm thick N52 neodynium magnet (if using magnetically attached film carriers)
* 8x M2x6mm pan head self-tapping screw for plastic (head diameter 4mm or less)
* 4x 8mm diameter adhesive-backed rubber bumper (3M SJ5370 or equivalent)

Note: the reflector box housing and diffuser bezel are available in two variants, screw-together and snap-fit. The snap-fit versions are designed specifically to print in ABS on a very well-tuned printer with a heated chamber; good results are not guaranteed otherwise.

### 35mm film carrier

* 2x 3D printed 35mm film carrier half
* 3D printed 35mm mask
* 3D printed 35mm film carrier hood
* 2x M2x10mm pan head self-tapping screw for plastic
* 4x 4mm diameter x 2mm thick N52 neodynium magnet

### medium format film carrier

* 2x 3D printed medium format film carrier half
* 3D printed masks (optional)
* 2x M2x10mm pan head self-tapping screw for plastic (head diameter 4mm or less)
* 4x 4mm diameter x 2mm thick N52 neodynium magnet

### horizontal mount

*camera_height* is the vertical distance in millimeters between the bottom flat surface of your camera's Arca-Swiss quick release plate and the central axis of the lens.

* 20x20mm T-slot aluminum extrusion at least 350mm long, depending on close focusing ability of your lens
* 3D printed diffuser mount
* 3D printed camera clamp cleat
* 3D printed camera clamp cam
* 3D printed camera clamp slider
* 3D printed M3x1mm spacer (quantity = 4 * (*camera_height* - 37))
* 4x M3 socket head cap screw (length = 12 + (*camera_height* - 37) +/- 2 mm)
* M3 washers (as needed)
* 4x M3 heat-set insert (5mm diameter, 4-5mm length)
* 2x M3x8 socket head cap screw
* 2x M3 T-slot nut for 2020 aluminum extrusion
* 1x M5x8mm button head cap screw
* 1x M5x12mm socket head cap screw
* 2x M5 T-slot nut for 2020 aluminum extrusion
